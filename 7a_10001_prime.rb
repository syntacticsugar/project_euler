# By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

# What is the 10 001st prime number?
#
#
# ewwwww!!!!  this problem looks hard!!!!
#
# okay, all the following tests pass
# puts 10.odd?
# puts "13.  #{13.prime?}"
# puts "3.  #{3.prime?}"
# puts "18.  #{18.prime?}"

FOREVER = (1/0.0)
